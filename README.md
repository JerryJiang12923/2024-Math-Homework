# Project Overview

In this research, several directories and files are utilized to ensure smooth data processing and result generation. The following is a detailed explanation of the structure and purpose of these directories and files:

## 1. Source File Storage
- **./gpxroutes_originally_gpxfiles**: Contains GPX route files downloaded directly from AllTrails. These files include time data but have imprecise elevation data.
- **./gpxtracks**: Stores GPX track files downloaded directly from AllTrails, which include precise elevation data but lack time data.
- **./merged_gpx**: Contains GPX files generated by merging accurate elevation data with time data using the `mergedata.py` script.
- **./gpxfiles**: Contains intact GPX files awaiting processing and output results generated by the main program.
- **./gpsfix**: Contains route data for several GPX track files with minor issues. These files cannot be processed with the merged files and must be processed using the original GPX route file data. The processing tool used here is `math_analyze_bugfix`.

## 2. Data Processing and Analysis
- **math_analyze.py**: The main program used to analyze GPX files in the `./gpxfiles` directory and generate corresponding CSV files.
- **final_calculation.py**: Calculates the final results and generates the `trail_energy_analysis.txt` file, which is stored in the `./RESULT` directory.
- **mergedata.py**: Merges GPX files to create files that include both precise elevation and time data, stored in the `./merged_gpx` directory.

## 3. Additional Information
- **./output_history**: Contains some historical model analysis results.
- **./RESULT**: The directory where final output data is stored.
- **./time_adjustment**: Contains files used to correct erroneous time data in GPX files.
- **debug.py**: A script for debugging errors, not yet used in the formal analysis.
